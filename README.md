👋 Hi! I’m Daniel. Nice to meet you.

You might be wondering how I can help your team or your project…

In 2018, when I first became aware of blockchain, I discovered that crypto tokens are much MORE than just financial assets. They make it easy to transfer money between different countries to avoid the high commissions from banks.

I started reading about blockchain and using Dapps like Coinbase, Uphold, and Binance. I wanted to help the world create great blockchain Dapps so people can live in a better financial system.

So I started watching blockchain and smart contract courses at Udemy and Platzy to become a guru blockchain developer.

A project that made me very proud to do was in Spozz, where 𝗜 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝟳𝟮𝟭 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟭𝟭𝟱𝟱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘇𝘇 𝗡𝗙𝗧 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 +𝟐𝟓,𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝟯 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀 - 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐟 𝐈 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧’𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 learning about blockchain.

In general, I consider my top 3 skills to be:

• Leading Team Members to Accomplish a Shared Goal
• Advanced Solidity Proficiency
• Developing Simple, Creative Solutions to Complex Problems

I also have extensive experience with:

• ReactJS
• NodeJS
• C
• C++
• Go
• Python
• Listening to Developers’ Challenges and Concerns
• Communicating with US Clients
• Conducting Technical Interviews with Candidates
• Managing a Team of 6 Junior Middle and Senior Developers
• Prioritizing Product Backlogs for 3 Different Products

🤔 Do You Think I Can Help Your Team/Project?
