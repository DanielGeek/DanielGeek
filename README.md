👋 Hi! I’m Daniel. Nice to meet you.

You might be wondering how I can help your team or your project…

When I started to work as a Software Engineer for large companies, I discovered that this kind of job is much MORE than just being a good programmer.

I started listening carefully to my team. 

I understood that hearing them is the best way to know how can I help the team to achieve the goal.
