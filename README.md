👋 Hi! I’m Daniel. Nice to meet you.

You might be wondering how I can help your team or your project…

In 2018, when I first became aware of blockchain, I discovered that crypto tokens are much MORE than just financial assets. They make it easy to transfer money between different countries to avoid the high commissions from banks.

I started reading about blockchain and using Dapps like Coinbase, Uphold, and Binance. I wanted to help the world create great blockchain Dapps so people can live in a better financial system.

So I started watching blockchain and smart contract courses at Udemy and Platzy to become a guru blockchain developer.
